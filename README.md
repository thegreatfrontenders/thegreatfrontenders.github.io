## üìò JavaScript Study Guide: Reimplementing Array Methods Using the One Piece API

---

### üî∞ Overview

This guide is designed to help you reinforce core JavaScript skills by reimplementing commonly used array methods using real-world data from the [One Piece API](https://api.api-onepiece.com/v2/characters/en). You'll also get practice with async/await and fetch calls.

---

### 1. üß≠ Goal

- Recreate foundational JavaScript methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc.) from scratch.
- Use character data from the One Piece API to test your implementations.
- Strengthen your mental model for async operations and working with real API data.

---

### 2. üåä Fetching the Data

**Task**:

- Write a function to fetch character data from the One Piece API.
- Handle loading, success, and error states.
- Store the data in a usable array format for testing your custom methods.

API Endpoint & Documentation:

### 3. üîÅ Reimplement JavaScript Array Methods

> ‚ùó Do not use the built-in versions (e.g. Array.prototype.map) when writing your custom methods.
> 

### `myForEach`

- Should loop over each character.
- Should invoke a callback with each item, its index, and the full array.

---

### `myMap`

- Should transform each character into a new value (e.g. just their names or aliases).
- Return a new array.

---

### `myFilter`

- Should return a subset of characters (e.g. only those from the Straw Hat Pirates).

---

### `myReduce`

- Should reduce all character data into a single value (e.g. a count of characters by affiliation).

---

### (Bonus) `myFind`, `mySome`, `myEvery`

- Challenge yourself to create additional versions of these based on real use cases from the API response.

---

### 4. üß™ Apply Your Methods to One Piece Data

**Challenge Ideas**:

- Use `myMap` to create an array of all character names.
- Use `myFilter` to find all characters affiliated with ‚ÄúMarine‚Äù.
- Use `myReduce` to tally how many characters exist per occupation.
- Use `myForEach` to print character names and bounty values to the console.

---

### 5. üß† Reflection

After implementing each method:

- What edge cases did you need to handle?
- How does your method compare to the native one?
- What do you now better understand about how JavaScript handles iteration and callbacks?

# Stories. (As a user...)

- when i first open the app, i see information about the main strawhats 
- I can see information about my favorite one piece characters by search 
    - Note ! we should use **debouncing** for this to make sure that we dont oversearch 
- I can play a game to guess the devil fruit of a random character 
- I can .....


# Tech Specs / components

- navbar (no login)
- home
    - straw hats 
    - search bar to find more about other people
- devil fruit guesser game
    - get all fruits here https://api.api-onepiece.com/v2/fruits/en
    - randomly select 10 characters and then make multiple choice of 5 fruits inlcuding their fruit 
    - can have funny rankings (ie if you get less than 2 right youre a fake fan)

- this should pull onload and store first x characters and fruits in localstorage 

# Learning
- Our website.io was showing our readme which is a fallback option of index.html when something isn't working properly
- I added npm install gh-pages and also "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" into our scripts
