# Redux 101! 

## [Thunk Overview](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks) 

#### What is a "thunk"?

_ridiculous name right lmao_

- The word "thunk" is a programming term that means "a piece of code that does some delayed work". Rather than execute some logic now, we can write a function body or code that can be used to perform the work later.

- For Redux specifically, "thunks" are a pattern of writing functions with logic inside that can interact with a Redux store's dispatch and getState methods.

- Using thunks requires the redux-thunk middleware to be added to the Redux store as part of its configuration.

- Thunks are a standard approach for writing async logic in Redux apps, and are commonly used for data fetching. However, they can be used for a variety of tasks, and can contain both synchronous and asynchronous logic.ad
